# binary-decimal-converter

## Description

This is a group project that integrates knowledge from Mathematics and Programming courses. The main objective was to develop a software program that converts numbers between binary and decimal formats. The program was built using the concepts learned so far, such as conditionals and loops.

The project allows the user to convert:

- Binary numbers (with sign bit) to decimal numbers.
- Decimal numbers to binary numbers (with sign bit).

Input validation is included to ensure the user enters correct values.

## Collaboration

This project was developed collaboratively using Google Colab, enabling real-time teamwork and code sharing.

## Usage

Run the program and follow the on-screen menu options:

1. Convert from binary to decimal  
2. Convert from decimal to binary

You will be prompted to enter the number and its sign (for binary input) or just the decimal number.

## How to Run

Execute the Python script in your environment:
